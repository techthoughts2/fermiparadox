One day I had a random idea that seemed like a solid explanation to the Fermi paradox.

I thought to myself, *I should write this down*.

But I didn't.

...I can't remember anything about that idea.

I felt pretty down about it so I decided to create this site to collect as many Fermi paradox theories as possible.

How can I get started making a quick static site like this?
