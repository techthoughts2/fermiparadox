## Alone

{{% bootstrap-blockquote author="?" %}}
We are truly alone. In all the infinite galaxies, stars, and combinations of planets, we are solitary in our uniqueness.
{{% /bootstrap-blockquote %}}

## Space Travel Is Too hard

{{% bootstrap-blockquote author="Michael Hart - Quarterly Journal of the Royal Astronomical Society, Vol. 16, p.128" %}}
Some physical, astronomical, biological or engineering difficulty makes space travel infeasible.
{{% /bootstrap-blockquote %}}

* There is a lack of resources in space that prevents long distance space travel.

## No Interest

{{% bootstrap-blockquote author="Michael Hart - Quarterly Journal of the Royal Astronomical Society, Vol. 16, p.128" %}}
They have chosen not to. A lack of interest, motivation or organization, political explanation.
{{% /bootstrap-blockquote %}}

* For a variety of potential reasons, advanced civilizations have elected not to establish communication.

## Time

{{% bootstrap-blockquote author="Michael Hart - Quarterly Journal of the Royal Astronomical Society, Vol. 16, p.128" %}}
Advanced civilizations are a more recent development in the universe. Their are civilizations capable of visiting us, but have not had time to reach us yet.

## We Missed It

{{% bootstrap-blockquote author="Michael Hart - Quarterly Journal of the Royal Astronomical Society, Vol. 16, p.128" %}}
They have come and gone, but humans were not here during that period to observe it.

## Life Is Too Fragile

*Gaian bottleneck hypothesis*

{{% bootstrap-blockquote author="Aditya Chopra - Astrobiology (2016)" %}}
Life may be rare in the universe, not because it is difficult to get started, but because habitable environments are difficult to maintain during the first billion years.
{{% /bootstrap-blockquote %}}

* Civilization experience periodic extinction by natural events.
  * The frequency of these events eclipses the frequency of achieving long term space exploration.
  * The galaxy is a dangerous place
     * gamma-ray bursts, asteroid impacts, etc

## Life Is Rare

*Emergence bottleneck hypothesis*

* Planetary bodies within habitable zones, that have the qualities to sustain life are incredibly rare.
* The Earth/Moon system is somewhat unique in that large liquid tides may be a key component needed for molecular evolution
* Even with ideal conditions, life's genesis is a rare event.

## Humans Are The Smartest

{{% bootstrap-blockquote author="?" %}}
Other civilizations exist, but they lack the advanced technology to make their presence known.
{{% /bootstrap-blockquote %}}

## Looking Time

{{% bootstrap-blockquote author="?" %}}
Humans have only been looking for other signs of life for around 80 years. In the terms of a galactic time scale, that isn't any time at all. We'll find them, we just haven't been looking very long.
{{% /bootstrap-blockquote %}}

## Too advanced

{{% bootstrap-blockquote author="?" %}}
Other civilizations are all around us, but we lack the means to identify them, or communicate with them due to their advanced nature.
{{% /bootstrap-blockquote %}}

## They are already here

{{% bootstrap-blockquote author="?" %}}
Another civilization is actively visiting us now. We are unaware.
{{% /bootstrap-blockquote %}}

## Too Far

{{% bootstrap-blockquote author="Webb, Stephen (2002). If the Universe Is Teeming with Aliens... Where Is Everybody?" %}}
There are many civilizations, but we are too far apart for meaningful two-way communication.
{{% /bootstrap-blockquote %}}

* Space may be bigger than we think - limiting accessibility.

## Virtual Evolution

{{% bootstrap-blockquote author="Bostrom, Nick (April 22, 2008). Where Are They?. MIT Technology Review." %}}
It has been suggested that some advanced beings may divest themselves of physical form, create massive artificial virtual environments, transfer themselves into these environments through mind uploading, and exist totally within virtual worlds, ignoring the external physical universe.
{{% /bootstrap-blockquote %}}

* It may be a course of natural evolution that advanced societies develop the capability to build massive artificial virtual environments. These environments could be powered through a variety of means for incredibly long periods. Armed with this technology, most civilizations elect to exist within their created world, rather than continue to existing in the physical one.
  * A [Matrioshka brain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrioshka_brain) might be used to achieve this.

## We're Isolated Intentionally

*planetarium hypothesis* / *zoo hypothesis*

{{% bootstrap-blockquote author="Baxter, Stephen, 2001, The Planetarium Hypothesis: A Resolution of the Fermi Paradox, Journal of the British Interplanetary Society, Vol. 54" %}}
Beyond a certain distance, the perceived universe is a simulated reality. This illusion, created by a [Type III civilization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale) capable of manipulating matter and energy on galactic scales, is intended to keep us in perpetual isolation. Our loneliness is engineered.

## Advanced civilizations are purposefully eliminated

{{% bootstrap-blockquote author="?" %}}
There is an active force within the cosmos that actively seeks out and eliminates other civilizations.
{{% /bootstrap-blockquote %}}

* A Type 3 civilization actively monitors for, and seeks to eliminate emerging civilizations.
